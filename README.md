# pet-suggester
Welcome to the Pet Suggester project! This Java program helps you find a pet by guiding you through a decision tree based on your preferences. You'll be asked a series of questions, and your answers will lead to suggested pets or the opportunity to expand the decision tree with new pet preferences.
The Pet Suggester program is implemented using the PetSuggester class and the TreeNode class. The TreeNode class represents nodes in a binary tree data structure, where each node holds a question or a pet suggestion. The PetSuggester class provides an interactive interface to guide users through the decision tree.
